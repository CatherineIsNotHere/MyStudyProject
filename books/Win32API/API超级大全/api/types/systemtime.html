<P><B>SYSTEMTIME</B>-type variables hold an exact date and time, down to the millisecond.  There are two ways this type stores dates: absolute and relative.  Absolute dates are &quot;normal&quot; dates, such as January 15, 1998 or December 25, 2001.  Relative dates are dates such as &quot;the 1<SUP>st</SUP> Sunday in June&quot; or &quot;the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> Wednesday in November&quot;, and are used when <VAR>wYear</VAR> is set to 0.  Here, <VAR>wDay</VAR> specifies whether it is the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth (last) week.
